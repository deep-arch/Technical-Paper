#What is DOM? 

DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It represents the way documents might be accessed or manipulated. Now, the object model resembles the structure of the documents it models. For example: 

```
<TABLE>
      <ROWS> 
      <TR> 
      <TD>Shady Grove</TD>
      <TD>Aeolian</TD> 
      </TR> 
      <TR>
      <TD>Over the River, Charlie</TD>
      <TD>Dorian</TD> 
      </TR> 
      </ROWS>
      </TABLE>
```

The Document Object Model representation looks like this:
